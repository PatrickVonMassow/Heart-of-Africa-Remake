 * Escape heading away from every threat within `radius`, distance-weighted and
 * summed (closer threats pull harder). Returns `null` when no threat is in
 * range.
 *
 * Summing over all nearby threats — rather than fleeing only the single nearest —
 * is what stops the facing from flip-flopping between two flanking herd members:
 * the nearest-threat pick is a discrete choice that swaps ~90° from frame to
 * frame when two elephants straddle the prey, whereas the summed field varies
 * continuously as the animal moves, so the heading stays stable (design.md §19).
