# TASKS — sequential feature batch

Working file for the current batch. Exactly one point is in progress at a time.
Each point: implement → adapt docs (incl. README/CLAUDE.md/design.md) → add
acceptance tests → run the full regression → commit atomically (only if fully
green) → tick it here → clear context and re-enter from this file.

On failure after correction attempts: STOP, report, and do not build further on a
broken base. Tests are never weakened; a red run is fixed in the production code.

This file and every new entry are written in English. Commit messages do not
reference the TASKS point number.

## Regression command

```sh
npm test          # full regression: build → lint → vitest → browser suites → preview
npm test -- flow  # a single browser suite (dev server managed for you)
```

`npm test` runs `scripts/verify/run-all.mjs`: it type-checks and builds
(`tsc -b` + `vite build`), lints (oxlint, zero warnings/errors), type-checks and
runs the fast **Vitest** layer (jsdom — pure logic, store transitions, HTML-HUD
components), then starts the Vite dev server (:5173) and runs the 13 browser
**Playwright** suites (`docs`, `world`, `i18n`, `flow`, `health`, `events`,
`collision`, `handwriting`, `polish`, `gamepad`, `voice`, `settings`,
`enrichments`) against it, and finally builds and runs the production-preview
smoke test (`preview.mjs`, :4173). It exits non-zero if any stage fails or logs a
browser console error. Prerequisites: `npm install` (Playwright + Chromium), a
free :5173/:4173. Individual browser suites can also be run directly with
`node scripts/verify/<name>.mjs` against a running dev server.

**Every point adds a test on the appropriate layer** — Vitest for anything
assertable without a browser, Playwright (`scripts/verify/*.mjs`) only for the
scene/RAF/geometry/CSS/audio/screenshot cases (`scripts/verify/README.md` holds
the map).

## Checklist

- [x] 1. Animals sometimes oscillate between two headings ~90° apart (seen while
  fleeing from elephants) — stabilise the direction choice so the facing no
  longer flip-flops.
- [x] 2. A predator eating a calf: the red stain and the calf shrinking start
  only after 5 s; during that window the calf still struggles. If a parent
  touches the predator within that window it sacrifices itself and is eaten
  instead of the calf, and the calf gets up and escapes; if the parent arrives
  too late, both are eaten. In addition, parents charge the predator as soon as a
  calf is being eaten.
  Reworked after review (the sacrifice fired but was invisible — the guard
  stood ~2 units from the calf, so the charge resolved within frames): the
  hunted calf now visibly flees (slower than the predator), the parent stands
  clear at the catch, making the rescue charge a visible ~1 s run; calf-hunt
  chance 0.45 → 0.6; fixed a spawn bug that mislinked families across chunk
  groups. Superseded by point 30 (living shield).
- [x] 3. Calves hop about playfully and sometimes fall into the water. Parents
  wade in and pull them out. In the attempt a calf or a parent can be swept over
  a waterfall and die; if a calf goes over a waterfall, the parents plunge after
  it and die.
- [x] 4. Spawn animals with enough spacing that they do not overlap; add
  collision detection so they do not walk through one another.
  (The elephant trample remains the designed exception: it must still be able
  to walk over a too-slow smaller animal.)
- [x] 5. Vultures: spawn outside the visible area and fly in (not appearing out
  of nowhere); after feeding they fly off and only despawn well outside the
  visible area. Account for the zoom level.
- [x] 6. Predators must not despawn within the visible area. In general: animals
  only despawn well outside the visible area (account for the zoom level).
  (Herd streaming already despawned beyond the zoom-aware ring; the offender
  was the scripted hunt predator, which left by timer and aborted at a fixed
  90 units — both now resolve only past the zoom-aware view ring.)
- [x] 7. When a predator leaves, it leaves behind a small remnant of prey that is
  then eaten by vultures.
- [x] 8. In the debug-menu-extended zoom mode one should be able to zoom out far
  enough to see the whole continent. So far this is prevented both by not being
  able to zoom out far enough and by haze obscuring the view. In the zoom range
  reachable only via the debug extension, no haze should be shown.
- [x] 9. When paddling through water in the canoe and the crocodile random event
  fires, a hint still appears suggesting one should better travel by canoe —
  although one already is.
  (The culprit was the first-time water danger warning, which always advised
  the canoe; with a canoe in the pack it now acknowledges its protection
  instead.)
- [x] 10. When something is discovered — such as a waterfall — it should be
  announced via the journal.
- [x] 11. The water in some lakes looks oddly blotchy and the blotches flicker
  while walking — e.g. in Lake Victoria.
- [x] 12. The blood stain of dying animals has gaps and looks more like a
  Pac-Man.
- [x] 13. More variety in the journal entries for the different villages. These
  should reflect locally/historically accurate peculiarities of each.
- [x] 14. One should be able to recover even without medicine. Currently one dies
  even from a light wound.
- [x] 15. Animals must not walk into the impassable open ocean (the water beyond
  the continent outline that blocks the traveller too).
- [x] 16. After using the new extended zoom-out and then entering a village,
  massive clipping errors appear when walking close to a hut (likely the raised
  debug-zoom camera near plane carrying over into the first-person scene).

- [x] 17. The movement oscillation persisted after point 1. Root cause: the
  summed threat field smoothed the heading only WITHIN the dodge, while the
  rendered facing was recomputed per behavior branch and snapped at every
  boundary — and elephants never rendered their travel heading at all. Fixed
  with one persistent facing per animal, steered by every behavior at a
  capped turn rate, exit-ring hysteresis on the dodge, flights ending in
  their run direction, elephants facing their line of travel. (The suggested
  nearest-threat pick was rejected: it would reintroduce the ~90° flip.)

- [x] 18. The walkable continent ends at the Red Sea. Everything northeast of
  the African Red Sea coast (the Red Sea itself, Sinai, the Arabian peninsula)
  is open, impassable ocean — the same as the sea around the rest of the
  continent. No special treatment of the Red Sea as inland water.
  (Boundary polyline slightly seaward of the ~1890 coast — Mediterranean →
  Suez → Bab-el-Mandeb → Gulf of Aden — in src/world/redSea.ts; isBlocked()
  blocks northeast of it and loadGeodata() stamps those DEM texels to ocean,
  which the bathymetry texture also reads. Two baseline probes contradicted
  the task and are pinned as-is: the Mozambique channel was already blocked,
  the Sidra bight already swimmable.)

- [x] 19. At the continent's edges one can swim a long way out into the open
  ocean — that must not be possible. Land masses outside the walkable
  continent are still visible on the map material and must be removed. And a
  scrap of the Red Sea still juts into the land.
  (Swimmable sea capped at a calibratable coastal band —
  balance.oceanSwimMarginDeg 1.2°, debug-editable — on top of the unchanged
  hull rules. The northeast stamp became a keep-flood trim in
  trimToGameWorld(): only land connected to the game's land-mass seeds
  survives. The Red Sea scrap came from boundary vertices biting into the
  real coast; the flood keeps African-connected land, and a raw-DEM scan
  asserts trimmed borders keep land only at the Suez isthmus gate.)
- [x] 20. In the debug zoom-out, walking produces oddities: the ocean moves
  offset against the land mass, and the landscape is only rendered in a
  rectangular area that covers a fraction of the visible range.
  (Two causes: the scaled water plane's shader reconstructed world XZ from
  the unscaled local position — a planeScale uniform now tracks the mesh
  scale; and the "rectangle" was the detailed chunk area against the
  far-terrain sheet — the sheet now bakes the chunks' mean ground-texture
  response (farColor.ts, pure-tested) and the chunk-bound dressing hides
  beyond zoom 3.)
- [x] 21. After the recent wave of design.md changes (restructure into numbered
  subsections, §7.1 slimming, the Red Sea/world-trim work), review README.md
  and bring it in step where it has drifted.
  (The README cites no §s, so none needed fixing. Drift closed across the
  gameplay list, stack list, scripts, geodata trim note and test-strategy
  link; the criteria count stays 32, docs.mjs green.)
- [x] 22. Fully zoomed out in the debug mode, the ocean still renders
  incorrectly — especially in the northeast.
  (Three layers fixed: the shader clamp-repeated the bathymetry edge texels
  into streaks — beyond the DEM bbox it now blends to plain deep ocean; the
  trim stamp deepened -1000 → -3000 m; and ghost shallows (trimmed-island
  shelf rings, shallow sea northeast of the boundary) are deepened via a
  dilated stamp mask. The African coast keeps its real shelf bathymetry.)
- [x] 23. In the west-southwest a large, unreachable land mass is still shown;
  it must be removed from the map as well.
  (Not reproducible as literal land: cap-zoom sweeps from four positions
  show no land outside the game's land masses. Likeliest culprit was the
  point-22 artifact family — clamped edge bands and bright ghost shallows
  reading as sand-colored land — all gone now. Resolved as Madagascar in
  point 25.)
- [x] 24. F3 (full loadout) should also unlock the extended zoom mode.
  (The F3 handler now enables the wheel-zoom unlock alongside the loadout;
  asserted in src/ui/Hud.test.tsx via a window keydown.)
- [x] 25. The unreachable land mass of point 23 is identified (user
  screenshot): it is Madagascar. It cannot be reached in the game and must
  therefore be removed from the map material — the rendered world and the
  exploration map alike.
  (Trim seed and coastline polygon removed, so the world trim stamps it to
  deep ocean and the exploration map no longer sketches it; its shelf banks
  left ghost outlines, so trimmed-box shallows deepen up to 800 m and the
  deep tone saturates by ~1600 m. design.md §3.1, CLAUDE.md pt. 4, README
  and the redSea tests follow.)

- [x] 26. One purchased food unit should last four weeks instead of one.
  (New balance value foodUnitDays 28, used by both buy paths — port money
  and village gifts — debug-menu editable in both languages; economy store
  test asserts against the balance value.)
- [x] 27. The journal panel should keep a small gap to the right screen edge.
  (.journal right: 0 → 12px; enrichments asserts the panel's right edge
  keeps a gap to the viewport edge.)
- [x] 28. Raise the canoe speed factor to 3x.
  (balance.canoeSpeedup 2 → 3; balance default test and the CLAUDE.md pt. 20
  checked number follow.)
- [x] 29. Shrink the re-entry debounce radius against accidentally re-entering
  a settlement.
  (placeReentryMargin 2 → 1; the leavePlace exit offset shrinks with it,
  from enterRadius+1.5 to enterRadius+0.5, so the exit point stays inside
  the clearance and the debounce still arms — points 26-29 land as one
  calibration commit since they share balance.ts/store.ts hunks.)
- [x] 30. During a calf hunt the parent must not flee with the calf — it
  protects it: while the chase runs it holds itself between hunter and young
  (a living shield, taken in the calf's place if the hunter reaches it), and
  only once a calf is caught does it charge the predator to sacrifice itself.
  (Replaces the former escort run — an intermediate head-on-charge variant
  landed as its own commit and was revised on request; blockHeading
  station-keeping is pure-tested, the enrichments choreography asserts the
  held shield line, the mid-chase take without any catch, and the preserved
  catch→struggle→charge fallback.)
- [x] 31. Juveniles must read as young beyond their smaller body: baby schema
  within the schematic animal style.
  (Per-species calf geometries — proportionally larger head on a shorter
  neck, shorter rounder body, leggy stance, no horns/tusks/beard/mane, the
  elephant calf with stubby trunk and smaller ears — rendered through own
  instanced calf meshes; fauna.test.ts asserts the proportions, enrichments
  the live calf-mesh instancing. Lands as one commit with point 30 (shared
  hunks); also hardens the kill-flock remnant check against inherited
  suite state by resetting the kill flight to idle up front.)
- [x] 32. design.md reads as iteratively grown — mechanics described in too
  many words (e.g. the parents' sacrifice, §19.8). Condense it against the
  code, and rework the other MD files in the project.
  (design.md tightened section by section with the § numbering and every
  binding mechanic/value unchanged; CLAUDE.md §7.1 kept all Verifiable
  conditions but moved the stale mappings of the seven deleted Playwright
  suites (economy, hints, expedition, reputation, camps, saveload,
  checkpoint) to their Vitest homes and split the pt. 12/20 walls into
  topic bullets; README/scripts READMEs caught up (TRAA on by default,
  current suite list); the long TASKS notes compacted to root cause +
  outcome.)
- [x] 33. Travelling water with a canoe now shows the explorer seated in it,
  but the hull sits partly under the water surface and reads poorly. Raise
  the canoe so it rides on the surface with only a shallow draft.
  (A CANOE_WATERLINE lift (0.18) raises the ridden hull and the seated rider
  together, so the hull rides on the surface with a shallow draft and the
  gunwale rim reads clearly; verified per zoomed screenshot 88.)
- [x] 34. On land, make it recognizable that the explorer is transporting the
  canoe (carrying or dragging it — whichever reads better in the bird's-eye
  view).
  (Dragging reads best at the steep-oblique bird's-eye angle (an overhead
  portage would occlude the figure): a second canoe instance trails behind
  the walking explorer along his heading, near end lifted to the grip, far
  end resting on the ground. The hull geometry is shared by the ridden and
  the dragged canoe via a CanoeHull component; __player exposes canoeing +
  carrying, enrichments asserts ride-on-water / drag-on-land / neither, and
  screenshot 89 shows the drag.)

- [x] 35. Make the explorer's injury visible on the bird's-eye figure: when he
  carries a wound (light/severe), it shows on the character, scaling with the
  wound level.
  (Wound marks toggle on the Player by afflictions.wounds. Placed on the
  crown and shoulders — the surfaces that read from the steep top-down angle,
  where torso/chest marks were occluded by the helmet: light = an off-white
  bandage strap over the helmet with a blood spot, severe = the strap runs
  red and blood soaks both shoulders. __player.wounds drives the toggle;
  enrichments asserts the severe-shows / healed-clears path with screenshot
  90.)
- [x] 36. Add a health bar at the bottom left: green at 100 % health, shading
  ever redder toward 0 %.
  (A HealthBar HUD element in the bottom-left corner; the fill width tracks
  health / balance.health.max and its colour sweeps hue 120→0 (green→red) as
  health drops. The inventory bar moved up 24px to sit above it. Localized
  label (Health/Gesundheit); Hud.test.tsx asserts full-width-green at full
  health and shrink-reddens toward zero.)

## Closing (only after all points)

1. Full regression over the whole state.
2. Thorough dead-code / stale-doc / stale-comment cleanup — as separate commits,
   not mixed with feature commits.
3. Full regression again.
