# TASKS — sequential feature batch

Working file for the current batch. Exactly one point is in progress at a time.
Each point: implement → adapt docs (incl. README/CLAUDE.md/design.md) → add
acceptance tests → run the full regression → commit atomically (only if fully
green) → tick it here → clear context and re-enter from this file.

On failure after correction attempts: STOP, report, and do not build further on a
broken base. Tests are never weakened; a red run is fixed in the production code.

This file and every new entry are written in English. Commit messages do not
reference the TASKS point number.

## Regression command

```sh
npm test          # full regression: build → lint → vitest → browser suites → preview
npm test -- flow  # a single browser suite (dev server managed for you)
```

`npm test` runs `scripts/verify/run-all.mjs`: it type-checks and builds
(`tsc -b` + `vite build`), lints (oxlint, zero warnings/errors), type-checks and
runs the fast **Vitest** layer (jsdom — pure logic, store transitions, HTML-HUD
components), then starts the Vite dev server (:5173) and runs the 13 browser
**Playwright** suites (`docs`, `world`, `i18n`, `flow`, `health`, `events`,
`collision`, `handwriting`, `polish`, `gamepad`, `voice`, `settings`,
`enrichments`) against it, and finally builds and runs the production-preview
smoke test (`preview.mjs`, :4173). It exits non-zero if any stage fails or logs a
browser console error. Prerequisites: `npm install` (Playwright + Chromium), a
free :5173/:4173. Individual browser suites can also be run directly with
`node scripts/verify/<name>.mjs` against a running dev server.

**Every point adds a test on the appropriate layer** — Vitest for anything
assertable without a browser, Playwright (`scripts/verify/*.mjs`) only for the
scene/RAF/geometry/CSS/audio/screenshot cases (`scripts/verify/README.md` holds
the map).

## Checklist

- [x] 1. Animals sometimes oscillate between two headings ~90° apart (seen while
  fleeing from elephants) — stabilise the direction choice so the facing no
  longer flip-flops.
- [ ] 2. A predator eating a calf: the red stain and the calf shrinking start
  only after 5 s; during that window the calf still struggles. If a parent
  touches the predator within that window it sacrifices itself and is eaten
  instead of the calf, and the calf gets up and escapes; if the parent arrives
  too late, both are eaten. In addition, parents charge the predator as soon as a
  calf is being eaten.
- [ ] 3. Calves hop about playfully and sometimes fall into the water. Parents
  wade in and pull them out. In the attempt a calf or a parent can be swept over
  a waterfall and die; if a calf goes over a waterfall, the parents plunge after
  it and die.

## Closing (only after all points)

1. Full regression over the whole state.
2. Thorough dead-code / stale-doc / stale-comment cleanup — as separate commits,
   not mixed with feature commits.
3. Full regression again.
